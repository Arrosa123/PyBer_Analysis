-  The Suburban cities fares were around $700 to $1300 during this time and fall in between urban and rural cities. 
-  The rural cities fares were around $300 to $500 during January to May 2019 period.

## Summary:
Based on the analysis mojority of PyBer's revenue is from the urban cities because more usage of PyBer rides in the urban cities. Data for rural cities shows that the average fare per ride and average fare per driver is much higher than Suburban and urban cities. This indicate that rural area based riders are taking trips over a longer distance. Or may be urban cities have more population and people like taking rides instead of driving.
